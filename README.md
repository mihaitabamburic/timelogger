Implement a simple time logger web application that solves the following three user stories:

1. As a freelancer I want to be able to register how I spend time on my _projects_, so that I can provide my _customers_ with an overview of my work
2. As a freelancer I want to be able to get an _overview of my time registrations per project_, so that I can create correct invoices for my customers
2. As a freelancer I want to be able to _sort my projects by their deadline_, so that I can prioritise my work

Individual time registrations should be 30 minutes or longer, and once a project is complete it can no longer receive new registrations
